# Grillo run-book

How to use each part of Grillo, one section per feature. Each feature's story edits only its own section.

## Setup

Nothing to do yet: the setup check arrives with its own story.

## Projects

Nothing to do yet: project creation and invitations arrive with their own story.

## Map and tickets

Nothing to do yet: the map and its tickets arrive with their own story.

## Agents

The agent runtime is in place; the tab that shows an agent's terminal arrives with its own story.

- **Claude Code must be installed and on PATH.** Each agent is your own `claude`, started with no extra flags
  in the project folder. Without it, starting an agent fails with "Claude Code was not found: there is no
  `claude` command on PATH".
- **Answer Claude Code's own startup questions yourself.** The first time it opens a folder it asks whether
  you trust it. Grillo waits; it types the agent's first message, then Enter, only once the message box appears.
- **Grillo's skills are copied in on every start.** Every `grillo-*` skill goes into the project folder's
  `.claude/skills/`, so updates arrive. A copy the project's repository tracks is never overwritten: Grillo
  skips it and logs a warning. The copied folders are listed in `.git/info/exclude`, so they never show as
  changes. Grillo writes no `CLAUDE.md`; your own user-level `CLAUDE.md` still applies.
- **Several agents run at once**; stopping one leaves the others running. Closing Grillo stops them all.
- **The waiting dot:** an agent counts as waiting for you once it has printed nothing for 3 seconds after
  printing something, and stops waiting as soon as it prints again.
