# Grillo run-book

How to use each part of Grillo, one section per feature. Each feature's story edits only its own section.

## Setup

The setup screen arrives with its own story. Underneath it, Grillo already checks the two tools every member needs
and reads who the member is on GitHub. It holds no credentials: it only asks each tool about its own sign-in.

### How Grillo checks the tools

| Tool | Installed when | Signed in when | What Grillo tells the member when it is missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude --version` runs | `claude auth status --json` prints `"loggedIn": true` | Install: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup>. Sign in: `claude auth login` |
| GitHub command-line tool | `gh --version` runs | `gh auth status --active --hostname github.com` exits with 0 (only the account Grillo uses) | Install: <https://cli.github.com/>. Sign in: `gh auth login --web` |

- **No model usage is spent.** `claude auth status` reads Claude Code's own local sign-in and prints it; it starts no
  session and sends no prompt. Grillo never reads the credentials file or the keychain itself.
- Any status answer Grillo cannot read counts as signed out, so the member sees the sign-in command.
- Grillo looks for each tool on the PATH first, then in the folders installers use even when the PATH does not list
  them yet: `~/.local/bin` on every system; `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` on a Mac; the GitHub CLI and
  WinGet folders on Windows. So a tool installed while Grillo is open is found by "Check again", without a restart.
- A tool that does not answer within 15 seconds is stopped and reported without a version.
- Results are kept for 10 seconds; "Check again" asks the tools afresh.

### Who the member is on GitHub

Grillo reads the login, name and email with `gh api user`. When the profile keeps the email private, Grillo asks
`gh api user/emails` for the primary address. That second call needs the read-only `user:email` scope (permission), which a plain
`gh auth login` does not grant, so the email then stays empty. To show it, run `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s user:email`.
A signed-out `gh` is reported as signed out, never as an error.
